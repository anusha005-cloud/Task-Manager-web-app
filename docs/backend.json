    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure Authorization Independence, DBAC, and QAPs. It leverages path-based ownership for user data and tasks. Specifically, tasks are stored within user-specific subcollections (`/users/{userId}/tasks/{taskId}`), enforcing clear ownership and simplifying security rules.  The `userId` on the task document is redundant given path-based ownership, but simplifies queries (though queries are discouraged for ownership checks as rules are not filters).  This eliminates the need for complex `get()` calls in security rules. Data segregation is achieved by storing user-specific data in separate collections. This structure supports secure `list` operations, as rules can easily verify the `userId` against `request.auth.uid`."
