# **App Name**: TaskFlow

## Core Features:

- Task Creation: Allow users to create and add tasks to their to-do list with descriptions and due dates.
- Task Categorization: Allow users to sort tasks using a pre-defined ontology of work and home.
- Smart Reminders: The app uses AI to decide when to send you friendly task reminders. The AI uses time and task difficulty as tools to estimate when to remind the user about the tasks.
- Task Completion: Mark tasks as complete and track progress.
- Theme Toggle: Allow users to switch between a light and dark theme using a toggle.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color (Light Theme): Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) to evoke focus and calmness.
- Background color (Light Theme): Very light Indigo (#E8EAF6), almost white, for a clean and calm backdrop.
- Accent color (Light Theme): Blue (#303F9F), slightly different than primary in brightness, for interactive elements.
- Primary color (Dark Theme): Dark Grey (#121212) for a modern and less eye-straining look.
- Background color (Dark Theme): Even Darker Grey (#000000) for contrast.
- Accent color (Dark Theme): Teal (#008080) for interactive elements to stand out against the dark background.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that combines a modern look and a little warmth.
- Use minimalist and clear icons for task actions (e.g., edit, delete, complete).
- Clean and organized layout with clear visual hierarchy for task prioritization.
- Subtle animations for task transitions and completion feedback.
